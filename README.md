# CVAE-GAN-zoos-PyTorch-Beginner
For beginner, this will be the best start for VAEs, GANs, and CVAE-GAN. 

This contains AE, DAE, VAE, GAN, CGAN, DCGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, VAE-GAN, CVAE-GAN. 
All use PyTorch.
All use MNIST dataset and you do not need download anything but this Github.

If you are new to GAN and AutoEncoder, I advice you can study these models in such a sequence.

1,GAN->DCGAN->WGAN->WGAN-GP

2,GAN->CGAN

3,AE->DAE->VAE

4 if you finish all above models, it time to study CVAE-GAN.

I have spent two days on rebuilding all these models using PyTorch and I believe you can do better and faster.

Let's see the results of CVAE-GAN:

you can generate any photos as you like

you can find out how a number change to a different one. It's interesting!
